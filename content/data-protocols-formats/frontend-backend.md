Vertica uses a message-based protocol for communication between frontends and backends (clients and servers). The protocol is supported over TCP/IP sockets. This document describes version 3.14 of the protocol.

For purposes of the protocol, the terms "backend" and "server" are interchangeable; likewise "frontend" and "client" are interchangeable. See [vertica-python](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-python) for a frontend implementation reference of the protocol.

## Overview

The protocol has separate phases for startup and normal operation.

In the startup phase, the frontend opens a connection to the backend and authenticates itself to the satisfaction of the backend. (This might involve a single message, or multiple messages depending on the authentication method being used.) If all goes well, the backend then sends status information to the frontend, and finally enters normal operation. Except for the initial startup-request message, this part of the protocol is driven by the backend.

During normal operation, the frontend sends queries and other commands to the backend, and the backend sends back query results and other responses. There are a few cases wherein the backend will send unsolicited messages, but for the most part this portion of a session is driven by frontend requests.

Termination of the session is normally by frontend choice, but can be forced by the backend in certain cases. In any case, when the backend closes the connection, it will roll back any open (incomplete) transaction before exiting.

Within normal operation, SQL commands can be executed through either of two sub-protocols. In the "simple query" protocol, the frontend just sends a textual query string, which is parsed and immediately executed by the backend. In the "extended query" protocol, processing of queries is separated into multiple steps: parsing, binding of parameter values, and execution. This offers flexibility and performance benefits, at the cost of extra complexity.

Normal operation has additional sub-protocols for special operations such as COPY.

All communication is through a stream of messages. The byte order of all messages are big-endian (A special case in [WriteFile](#writefile-o) message). All data sending to or coming from the backend are represented as UTF-8.

### Formats and Format Codes

Data of a particular SQL data type might be transmitted in either "text" format or "binary" format. The desired format for any value is specified by a *format code*. Text has format code zero, binary has format code one, and all other format codes are reserved for future definition.

The text representation of values is whatever strings are produced and accepted by the input/output conversion functions for the particular data type. For example, the value of DATE/TIMESTAMP data is a date/timestamp in proleptic Gregorian calendar.

> **Note**: While PostgreSQL lets you change the format on a per-column/type basis in the protocol, Vertica currently does not honor that and instead does it as a session-level setting. So unfortunately that means its an all-or-nothing implementation - all data types must be implemented. To opt into binary format protocol for data reads from backend (queries), the frontend have to set the [StartupRequest](#startuprequest) message to include parameter 'binary_data_protocol' set to '1' ('0' is the default, which is the string format protocol), and set the [Bind](#bind-b) message's last two fields (result-column format code) as '1'. No Vertica clients currently support data writes (server-prepared statement bind values) to the backend in binaryformat.

## Message Flow

This section describes the message flow and the semantics of each message type. (Details of the exact representation of each message appear in Section [Message Formats](#message-formats).)

### Start-up

To begin a session, a frontend opens a connection over TCP/IP to the server. With a TCP socket, the frontend does the following steps:

#### Connection load balancing
  
A backend with load balancing enabled can redirect connections based on the connection's origin. To initiate a connection load balancing, the frontend sends a [LoadBalanceRequest](#loadbalancerequest) message. The server then responds with a [LoadBalanceResponse](#loadbalanceresponse-yn) message, the first byte of the message containing ***Y***or***N***, indicating that it is willing or unwilling to perform load balancing, respectively. To continue after***Y***, the frontend must create a new TCP socket, which connects to the new host/port specified in the [LoadBalanceResponse 'Y'](#loadbalanceresponse-yn) message. To continue after***N***, send the usual [SSLRequest](#sslrequest-8) message and [Startup](#startuprequest) message and proceed without connection load balancing.
  
To enable connection load balancing on the server side, please see Vertica documentation.

#### SSL session encryption

Frontend/backend communications can be encrypted using SSL. This provides communication security in environments where attackers might be able to capture the session traffic.
  
To initiate an SSL-encrypted connection, the frontend sends an [SSLRequest](#sslrequest-8) message. The server then responds with a single byte containing ***S***or***N***, indicating that it is willing or unwilling to perform SSL, respectively. The frontend might close the connection at this point if it is dissatisfied with the response. To continue after***S***, perform an SSL startup handshake (not described here, part of the SSL specification) with the server. If this is successful, all subsequent data will be SSL-encrypted. To continue after***N***, send the usual [Startup](#startuprequest) message and proceed without encryption.

To enable TLS/SSL communications on the server side, please see Vertica documentation.

#### Startup message and authentication
  
Once the socket setup is done, the frontend sends a [StartupRequest](#startuprequest) message to the backend. This message includes the names of the user and of the database the user wants to connect to; it also identifies the particular protocol version to be used. Optionally, the [StartupRequest](#startuprequest) message can include additional settings for run-time parameters. The server then uses this information to determine whether the connection is provisionally acceptable, and what additional authentication is required (if any).
  
The server then sends an appropriate authentication request message, to which the frontend must reply with an appropriate authentication response message (such as a [Password](#password-p)).

The authentication cycle ends with the server either rejecting the connection attempt ([ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e)), or sending [AuthenticationOk](#authenticationok-r).

The possible messages from the server in this phase are:

[ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e)
: The connection attempt has been rejected. The server then immediately closes the connection.

[AuthenticationOk](#authenticationok-r)
: The authentication exchange is successfully completed.

[AuthenticationCleartextPassword](#authenticationcleartextpassword-r)
: The frontend must now send a [Password](#password-p) message containing the password in clear-text form. If this is the correct password, the server responds with an [AuthenticationOk](#authenticationok-r), otherwise it responds with an [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e). 

[AuthenticationGSS](#authenticationgss-r)
: The frontend must now initiate a GSSAPI negotiation. The frontend will send a [Password](#password-p) message with the first part of the GSSAPI data stream in response to this. If further messages are needed, the server will respond with [AuthenticationGSSContinue](#authenticationgsscontinue-r). See [GSS-API/Kerberos Authentication](#gss-api--kerberos-authentication).

[AuthenticationGSSContinue](#authenticationgsscontinue-r)
: This message contains the response data from the previous step of GSSAPI negotiation (AuthenticationGSS, or a previous AuthenticationGSSContinue). If the GSSAPI data in this message indicates more data is needed to complete the authentication, the frontend must send that data as another [Password](#password-p) message. If GSSAPI authentication is completed by this message, the server will next send [AuthenticationOk](#authenticationok-r) to indicate successful authentication or [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e) to indicate failure.

[AuthenticationPasswordExpired](#authenticationpasswordexpired-r)
: The connection attempt has been rejected as the password is expired.

[AuthenticationPasswordGrace](#authenticationpasswordgrace-r)
: This message informs the frontend that the password will expire soon. The frontend can display a warning message. Then, the frontend must wait for further messages from the server.

[AuthenticationMD5Password](#authenticationmd5password-r) or [AuthenticationHashMD5Password](#authenticationhashmd5password-r)
: The frontend must now send a [Password](#password-p) message containing the password (with username) encrypted via MD5, then encrypted again using the 4-byte random salt specified in this message. If this is the correct password, the server responds with an [AuthenticationOk](#authenticationok-r), otherwise it responds with an [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e).

[AuthenticationHashPassword](#authenticationhashpassword-r) or [AuthenticationHashSHA512Password](#authenticationhashsha512password-r)
: The frontend must now send a [Password](#password-p) message containing the password (with the 16-byte user salt specified in this message) encrypted via SHA512, then encrypted again using the 4-byte random salt specified in this message. If this is the correct password, the server responds with an [AuthenticationOk](#authenticationok-r), otherwise it responds with an [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e).
 
If the frontend does not support the authentication method requested by the server, then it should immediately close the connection.

After having received AuthenticationOk, the frontend must wait for further messages from the server. In this phase a backend process is being started, and the frontend is just an interested bystander. It is still possible for the start-up attempt to fail (ErrorResponse), but in the normal case the backend will send some [ParameterStatus](#parameterstatus-s) messages, [BackendKeyData](#backendkeydata-k), and finally [ReadyForQuery](#readyforquery-z).

During this phase the backend will attempt to apply any additional run-time parameter settings that were given in the Startup message. If successful, these values become session defaults. An error causes ErrorResponse and exit.

The possible messages from the backend in this phase are:

[ParameterStatus](#parameterstatus-s)
: This message informs the frontend about the current (initial) setting of backend parameters, such as client_locale or auto_commit. The frontend can ignore this message, or record the settings for its future use. The frontend should not respond to this message, but should continue listening for a ReadyForQuery message.

[BackendKeyData](#backendkeydata-k)
: This message provides secret-key data that the frontend must save if it wants to be able to issue cancel requests later. The frontend should not respond to this message, but should continue listening for a ReadyForQuery message.

[ReadyForQuery](#readyforquery-z)
: Start-up is completed. The frontend can now issue commands.

[ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e)
: Start-up failed. The connection is closed after sending this message.

[NoticeResponse](#noticeresponse-n)
: A warning message has been issued. The frontend should display the message but continue listening for ReadyForQuery or ErrorResponse.

The [ReadyForQuery](#readyforquery-z) message is the same one that the backend will issue after each command cycle. Depending on the coding needs of the frontend, it is reasonable to consider ReadyForQuery as starting a command cycle, or to consider ReadyForQuery as ending the start-up phase and each subsequent command cycle.

### Authentication

#### GSS-API / Kerberos Authentication

GSS-API is _Generic Security Service API (RFC 2744)_. It provides a common interface for accessing different security services. One of the most popular security services available for GSS-API is the Kerberos v5.

Here are the most basic steps taken to authenticate in a Kerberized environment:

1. Client requests an authentication ticket (TGT) from the Key Distribution Center (KDC).
2. The KDC verifies the credentials and sends back an encrypted TGT and session key.
3. The TGT is encrypted using the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) secret key.
4. The client stores the TGT and when it expires the local session manager will request another TGT (this process is transparent to the user).


`kinit` in Linux is a command often used for obtaining or caching/renewing a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT).


When the client requests access to a server, this is the process:

1. The client sends a [StartupRequest](#startuprequest) message to the server.
2. The server sends back a [AuthenticationGSS](#authenticationgss-r) message to request GSS-API negotiation.
3. The client sends the current TGT to the TGS with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the Vertica server.
4. The KDC verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the Vertica server service.
5. TGS sends a valid session key for the service to the client.
6. Client forwards the session key (within a [Password](#password-p) message) to the server to prove the user has access.
7. If further messages are needed, the server will respond with a [AuthenticationGSSContinue](#authenticationgsscontinue-r) message. The client sends data as another [Password](#password-p) message.
8. The server grants access and sends a [AuthenticationOk](#authenticationok-r); or sends a [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e) to indicate failure.

#### OAuth2 authentication

OAuth lets client applications verify themselves to and receive an OAuth access token from an identity provider (IDP) like Keycloak or Okta. These client applications can then pass the access token to authenticate to Vertica server as a substitute for username & password.

A client application should first configure the IDP and get the following parameters:

- client_id: ID of the confidential client (application) registered in IDP. This is used by server to call introspection API to retrieve user grants; and used by client to retrieve tokens.

- client_secret: The secret of the confidential client (application) registered in IDP. This is used by server to call introspection API to retrieve user grants; and used by client to retrieve tokens.

- introspect_url: API used by server to introspect access token. This URL is exposed by IDP and must be accessible from server.

- token_url: API used by client to refresh the token. This URL is exposed by IDP and must be accessible from client.

![Example message flow of OAuth authentication](/images/data-protocols-formats/frontent-backend/OAuth_Msg_flow.png)

Then in the server, create an OAuth authentication record with above parameters, and grant it to the user.

The client application call the IDP token API to retrieve the following parameters:

- access_token: Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make connection requests on behalf of a user.

- refresh_token: Refresh tokens are used to obtain a new access token.

</figure>


#### (Protocol 3.11)

In the [StartupRequest](#startuprequest), only access_token is required to be specified in **oauth_access_token** parameter, no client id/secret is included in the request. The 'user' parameter is optional. The backend validates token using OAuth Introspect query. In case oauth_access_token is valid and permissions are sufficient, the backend sends [AuthenticationOk](#authenticationok-r), otherwise it responds with an [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e). Token refresh flow can be triggered by frontend after the token validation (if token introspection fails).

#### (Protocol 3.12)

In the [StartupRequest](#startuprequest), if the 'auth_category' parameter is specified as "OAuth", the server will send the client an [AuthenticationOAuth](#authenticationoauth-r) message. The client will respond with a [Password](#password-p) message containing an OAuth access token. The backend validates token using OAuth Introspect query. In case the access token is valid and permissions are sufficient, the backend sends [AuthenticationOk](#authenticationok-r), otherwise it responds with an [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e). Token refresh flow can be triggered by frontend after the token validation (if token introspection fails).

If 'auth_category' parameter is not set, the server still check for the token in the 'oauth_access_token' parameter of [StartupRequest](#startuprequest) message.

### Simple Query

A simple query cycle is initiated by the frontend sending a [Query](#query-q) message to the backend. The message includes an SQL command (or commands) expressed as a text string. The backend then sends one or more response messages depending on the contents of the query command string, and finally a [ReadyForQuery](#readyforquery-z) response message. ReadyForQuery informs the frontend that it can safely send a new command.


![Example message flow of simple query with data rows returned](/images/data-protocols-formats/frontent-backend/SimpleQuery_Msg_flow.png)

The possible response messages from the backend are:

- [CommandComplete](#commandcomplete-c)
  : An SQL command completed normally.

- [RowDescription](#rowdescription-t)
  : Indicates that rows are about to be returned in response to a query. The contents of this message describe the column layout of the rows. This will be followed by a DataRow message for each row being returned to the frontend.

- [VerifyFiles](#verifyfiles-f)
  : The backend starts processing a COPY LOCAL command; see Section [COPY Operations](#copy-operations) -- [Copy-Local mode](#copy-local-mode).

- [CopyInResponse](#copyinresponse-g)
  : The backend starts processing a COPY STDIN command; see Section [COPY Operations](#copy-operations) -- [Copy-Stdin mode](#copy-stdin-mode)

- [DataRow](#datarow-d)
  : One of the set of rows returned by a query.

- [EmptyQueryResponse](#emptyqueryresponse-i)
  : An empty query string was recognized.

- [ParameterStatus](#parameterstatus-s)
  : This message informs the frontend about the current setting of backend parameters, a SET query normally produce this message.

- [NoticeResponse](#noticeresponse-n)
  : A warning message has been issued in relation to the query. For example, issue a COMMIT when no transaction in progress. NoticeResponses are in addition to other responses, i.e., the backend will continue processing the command.

- [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e)
  : An error has occurred.

- [ReadyForQuery](#readyforquery-z)
  : Processing of the query string is complete. A separate message is sent to indicate this because the query string might contain multiple SQL commands. ([CommandComplete](#commandcomplete-c) marks the end of processing **one** SQL command, not the whole string.) ReadyForQuery will always be sent, whether processing terminates successfully or with an error.

The response to a SELECT query (or other queries that return row sets, such as EXPLAIN or SHOW) normally consists of [RowDescription](#rowdescription-t), zero or more [DataRow](#datarow-d) messages, and then [CommandComplete](#commandcomplete-c). COPY command invokes special protocol as described in Section [COPY Operations](#copy-operations). Other query types normally produce only a [CommandComplete](#commandcomplete-c) message.

Since a query string could contain several queries (separated by semicolons), there might be several such response sequences before the backend finishes processing the query string. ReadyForQuery is issued when the entire string has been processed and the backend is ready to accept a new query string.

If a completely empty (no contents other than whitespace) query string is received, the response is [EmptyQueryResponse](#emptyqueryresponse-i) followed by [ReadyForQuery](#readyforquery-z).

In the event of an error, [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e) is issued followed by ReadyForQuery. All further processing of the query string is aborted by ErrorResponse (even if more queries remained in it). Note that this might occur partway through the sequence of messages generated by an individual query.

Recommended practice is to code frontends in a state-machine style that will accept any message type at any time that it could make sense, rather than wiring in assumptions about the exact sequence of messages.

### Extended Query

The extended query protocol breaks down the above-described simple query protocol into multiple steps. The overall execution cycle consists of a *parse* step, which creates a prepared statement from a textual query string; a *bind* step, which creates a portal given a prepared statement and values for any needed parameters; and an *execute* step that runs a portal's query. One of the advantages of extended query protocol is preventing SQL injection attacks.

![Example message flow of extended query (Close message is not included)](/images/data-protocols-formats/frontent-backend/PreparedStatement_Msg_flow.png)

In the extended protocol, the frontend first sends a [Parse](#parse-p) message, which contains a textual query string. The query string leaves certain values (must be *SQL literals*; otherwise a syntax error is reported) unspecified with parameter placeholders (i.e. question mark '?'). The response is either [ParseComplete](#parsecomplete-1) or [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e).

> **Note**: The query string contained in a [Parse](#parse-p) message cannot include more than one SQL statement; else a syntax error is reported. This restriction does not exist in the simple-query protocol.
> 
> The query string contained in a [Parse](#parse-p) message cannot be a *COPY FROM LOCAL* SQL statement; else a protocol error is reported. See Section [Copy-Local mode](#copy-local-mode).

If successfully created, a named prepared-statement object lasts till the end of the current session, unless explicitly destroyed. Within a session, the backend can keep track of multiple prepared statements. Existing prepared statements and portals are referenced by names assigned when they were created. The frontend can optimize its behavior when the same query string is used, but different parameters are bound to it (many times), i.e. *parse* once and then *bind* & *execute* many times.

Once a prepared statement exists, it can be readied for execution using a [Bind](#bind-b) message. The [Bind](#bind-b) message gives the name of the source prepared statement, the name of the destination portal (empty string denotes the unnamed portal), and the values to use for any parameter placeholders ('?') present in the prepared statement. The supplied parameter set must match those needed by the prepared statement.
[Bind](#bind-b) also specifies the format to use for any data returned by the query; the format can be specified overall, or per-column. The response is either [BindComplete](#bindcomplete-2) or ErrorResponse.

> **Note**: In Vertica server, there is only one portal. The portal name required in some messages is actually ignored by the backend.

Once a portal exists, it can be executed using an [Execute](#execute-e) message. The [Execute](#execute-e) message specifies the portal name (empty string denotes the unnamed portal) and a maximum result-row count (Vertica backend ignores this and always fetch all rows). The possible responses to [Execute](#execute-e) are the same as those described above for queries issued via simple query protocol, except that Execute doesn't cause ReadyForQuery or RowDescription to be issued, also [PortalSuspended](#portalsuspended-s) replaced [CommandComplete](#commandcomplete-c) to indicate completion of the source SQL command.

At completion of each series of extended-query messages, the frontend should issue a [Sync](#sync-s) message. This parameterless message causes the backend to close the current transaction if it's not inside a BEGIN/COMMIT transaction block ("close" meaning to commit if no error, or roll back if error). Then a ReadyForQuery response is issued. The purpose of [Sync](#sync-s) is to provide a resynchronization point for error recovery. When an error is detected while processing any extended-query message, the backend issues ErrorResponse, then reads and discards messages until a [Sync](#sync-s) is reached, then issues ReadyForQuery and returns to normal message processing. (But note that no skipping occurs if an error is detected while processing Sync — this ensures that there is one and only one ReadyForQuery sent for each Sync.)

In most scenarios the frontend should issue a [Describe](#describe-d) before issuing [Execute](#execute-e), to ensure that it knows how to interpret the results it will get back. The [Describe](#describe-d) message (statement variant) specifies the name of an existing prepared statement. The response is a [ParameterDescription](#parameterdescription-t) message describing the parameters needed by the statement, followed by a [RowDescription](#rowdescription-t) message describing the rows that will be returned when the statement is eventually executed (or a [NoData](#nodata-n) message if the statement will not return rows), and followed by a [CommandDescription](#commanddescription-m) message describing the type of command to be executed and any semantically-equivalent COPY statement. ErrorResponse is issued if there is no such prepared statement. Note that since [Bind](#bind-b) has not yet been issued, the formats to be used for returned columns are not yet known to the backend; the format code fields in the [RowDescription](#rowdescription-t) message will be zeroes in this case. The [Describe](#describe-d) message (portal variant) specifies the name of an existing portal (or an empty string for the unnamed portal). The response is a [RowDescription](#rowdescription-t) message describing the rows that will be returned by executing the portal; or a [NoData](#nodata-n) message if the portal does not contain a query that will return rows; or ErrorResponse if there is no such portal.

The [Close](#close-c) message closes an existing prepared statement or portal and releases resources. It is not an error to issue Close against a nonexistent statement or portal name. The response is normally [CloseComplete](#closecomplete-3), but could be ErrorResponse if some difficulty is encountered while releasing resources. Note that closing a prepared statement implicitly closes any open portals that were constructed from that statement.

The [Flush](#flush-h) message does not cause any specific output to be generated, but forces the backend to deliver any data pending in its output buffers. A [Flush](#flush-h) must be sent after any extended-query command except [Sync](#sync-s), if the frontend wishes to examine the results of that command before issuing more commands. Without [Flush](#flush-h), messages returned by the backend will be combined into the minimum possible number of packets to minimize network overhead.

### COPY Operations

The COPY command allows high-speed bulk data transfer from the client to the server. COPY operations can be divided into *copy-local* mode (it is further divided into *copy-local-stdin* mode and *copy-local-file* mode) and *copy-stdin* mode.

#### Copy-Local mode

Copy-local mode is initiated when the backend executes a *COPY FROM LOCAL FILES* or *COPY FROM LOCAL STDIN* SQL statement in [Query](#query-q) message. The backend sends a [RowDescription](#rowdescription-t) message (For the DataRow message later indicating the number of rows loaded.) and a [VerifyFiles](#verifyfiles-f) message to the frontend. The backend parses the file names out of the command, and sends them back to the frontend in [VerifyFiles](#verifyfiles-f) message. If COPY command uses the REJECTED DATA and/or EXCEPTIONS parameters, VerifyFiles message contains filenames for them. In *copy-local-file* mode, VerifyFiles message also contains input filenames. The frontend has to verify that these input files exist and are readable, and rejected data and exceptions files are writable.

Then the frontend should send a [VerifiedFile](#emptyqueryresponse-i) message specifying a list of input files that the backend can ask to load. In *copy-local-stdin* mode, this is an empty list. In *copy-local-file* mode, this must be a non-empty list, because sending an empty list of files will make server kill the session. If the backend does not send a ErrorResponse, it is ready to copy data from STDIN/files. The backend might send [ParameterStatus](#parameterstatus-s) messages, then

- In *copy-local-file* mode, for each file to load, the backend sends a [LoadFile](#loadfile-h) message to ask for data from a file. The frontend should then send zero or more [CopyData](#copydata-d) messages, forming a stream of input data. The message boundaries are not required to have anything to do with row boundaries, although that is often a reasonable choice. The frontend should send a [EndOfBatchRequest](#endofbatchrequest-j) message to indicate that a batch of rows has been sent, and the frontend is expecting an acknowledgment and possibly rejected row descriptions from the backend. The backend should then send zero or more [WriteFile](#writefile-o) messages for rejected row descriptions and a [EndOfBatchResponse](#endofbatchresponse-j) message for acknowledgement of data loading from this file. When the backend finishes asking for data from all files, it sends a [CopyDoneResponse](#copydoneresponse-c) message.

      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example message flow of COPY FROM LOCAL FILE</figcaption>
 </figure> 

- In *copy-local-stdin* mode, the backend sends a [CopyInResponse](#copyinresponse-g) message to the frontend to ask for data. Same as in *copy-local-file* mode, the frontend should send zero or more [CopyData](#copydata-d) messages, forming a stream of input data, and a [EndOfBatchRequest](#endofbatchrequest-j) message and then receive zero or more [WriteFile](#writefile-o) messages and an [EndOfBatchRequest](#endofbatchrequest-j) message. In this mode, there will be no incoming message until the frontend send a [CopyDone](#copydone-c) message to end this STDIN loading.

</figure>


> **Security concerns**: The frontend must verify the file the backend asks for reading ([LoadFile](#loadfile-h)) or writing ([WriteFile](#writefile-o) is not tampered.

After loading all the data, the backend sends a [DataRow](#datarow-d) message indicating the number of rows loaded, and then a [CommandComplete](#commandcomplete-c) message indicating the end of the COPY command. The query string might contain multiple SQL commands, the backend will return to the command-processing mode of [Simple Query protocol](#simple-query) when a COPY command ended. ReadyForQuery will always be sent when the query string is complete.

In the event of a frontend-detected error during *copy-local* mode, the frontend can terminate it by sending a [CopyError](#copyerror-e) message, which will cause the COPY SQL statement to fail with an ErrorResponse. In the event of a backend-detected error (including receipt of a CopyError message), the backend will issue an ErrorResponse message, any subsequent messages issued by the frontend will simply be dropped, and ReadyForQuery is issued.

#### Copy-Stdin mode

This protocol comes from PostgreSQL and is (partially) supported in Vertica server but not implemented by most Vertica clients. The backend cannot report the number of rows loaded after copy, and possibly rejected row descriptions.

Copy-stdin mode is initiated when the backend executes a *COPY FROM STDIN* SQL statement (not "COPY FROM LOCAL STDIN") in a [Query](#query-q) message. The backend might send [ParameterStatus](#parameterstatus-s) messages, and then a [CopyInResponse](#copyinresponse-g) message to the frontend to ask for data. The frontend should send zero or more [CopyData](#copydata-d) messages, forming a stream of input data, and a [CopyDone](#copydone-c) message to end this STDIN loading. The backend should process the command and send a [CommandComplete](#commandcomplete-c) message indicating the end of the COPY command. The query string might contain multiple SQL commands, the backend will return to the command-processing mode of [Simple Query protocol](#simple-query) when a COPY command ended. ReadyForQuery will always be sent when the query string is complete.

![Example message flow of COPY FROM STDIN](/images/data-protocols-formats/frontent-backend/CopyStdin_Msg_flow.png)

In the event of a frontend-detected error during *copy-stdin* mode, the frontend can terminate it by sending a [CopyFail](#copyfail-f) or a [CopyError](#copyerror-e) message, which will cause the COPY SQL statement to fail with an ErrorResponse. In the event of a backend-detected error (including receipt of a CopyFail or a CopyError message), the backend will issue an ErrorResponse message, any subsequent CopyData, CopyDone, CopyFail or CopyError messages issued by the frontend will simply be dropped, and ReadyForQuery is issued.

Copy-stdin mode can also be initiated via [Extended Query protocol](#extended-query), the COPY command is issued in a [Parse](#parse-p) message. The workflow is the same as normal processing of [Extended Query protocol](#extended-query) except that the backend should send a [CopyInResponse](#copyinresponse-g) message after receiving an [Execute](#execute-e) message. Then the frontend should send zero or more [CopyData](#copydata-d) messages, forming a stream of input data, and a [CopyDone](#copydone-c) or [CopyFail](#copyfail-f)/[CopyError](#copyerror-e) message to end the STDIN loading.

### Asynchronous Operations

There are several cases in which the backend will send messages that are not specifically prompted by the frontend's command stream. Frontends must be prepared to deal with these messages at any time, even when not engaged in a query.

[NoticeResponse](#noticeresponse-n)
: It is possible for NoticeResponse messages to be generated due to outside activity; for example, if the database administrator commands a "fast" database shutdown, the backend will send a NoticeResponse indicating this fact before closing the connection. Accordingly, frontends should always be prepared to accept and display NoticeResponse messages, even when the connection is nominally idle.

[ParameterStatus](#parameterstatus-s)
: ParameterStatus messages will be generated whenever the active value changes for any of the parameters the backend believes the frontend should know about. For example, when you do `SET SESSION AUTOCOMMIT ON | OFF`, you get back a ParameterStatus telling you the new value of autocommit.
: At present Vertica supports a handful of parameters for which ParameterStatus will be generated, they are: *standard_conforming_strings*, *server_version*, *client_locale*, *client_label*, *long_string_types*, *protocol_version*, *auto_commit*, *mars*, etc.
: More parameters might be added in the future. A frontend should simply ignore ParameterStatus for parameters that it does not understand or care about.

### Canceling Requests in Progress

During the processing of a query, the frontend might request cancellation of the query. The cancel request is not sent directly on the open connection to the backend for reasons of implementation efficiency: we don't want to have the backend constantly checking for new input from the frontend during query processing. Cancel requests should be relatively infrequent, so we make them slightly cumbersome in order to avoid a penalty in the normal case.

To issue a cancel request, the frontend opens a new connection to the server and sends a [CancelRequest](#cancelrequest) message, rather than the Startup message that would ordinarily be sent across a new connection. The server will process this request and then close the connection. For security reasons, no direct reply is made to the cancel request message.

A [CancelRequest](#cancelrequest) message will be ignored unless it contains the same key data (PID and secret key) passed to the frontend during connection start-up. If the request matches the PID and secret key for a currently executing backend, the processing of the current query is aborted.

The cancellation signal might or might not have any effect — for example, if it arrives after the backend has finished processing the query, then it will have no effect. If the cancellation is effective, it results in the current command being terminated early with an error message saying "Execution canceled by operator".

The upshot of all this is that for reasons of both security and efficiency, the frontend has no direct way to tell whether a cancel request has succeeded. It must continue to wait for the backend to respond to the query. Issuing a cancel simply improves the odds that the current query will finish soon, and improves the odds that it will fail with an error message instead of succeeding.

Since the cancel request is sent across a new connection to the server and not across the regular frontend/backend communication link, it is possible for the cancel request to be issued by any process, not just the frontend whose query is to be canceled. This might provide additional flexibility when building multiple-process applications. It also introduces a security risk, in that unauthorized persons might try to cancel queries. The security risk is addressed by requiring a dynamically generated secret key to be supplied in [CancelRequest](#cancelrequest).

### Termination

The normal, graceful termination procedure is that the frontend sends a [Terminate](#terminate-x) message and immediately closes the connection. On receipt of this message, the backend closes the connection and terminates.

In rare cases (such as an administrator-commanded database shutdown) the backend might disconnect without any frontend request to do so. In such cases the backend will attempt to send an [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse-e) or [NoticeResponse](#noticeresponse-n) message giving the reason for the disconnection before it closes the connection.

## Message Data Types

This section describes the base data types used in messages.

Int<i>n</i>(<i>i</i>)   
: An <strong><i>n</i></strong>-bit integer in network byte order (most significant byte first). If <strong><i>i</i></strong> is specified it is the exact value that will appear, otherwise the value is variable. Eg. Int16, Int32(42).

Int<i>n</i>\[<i>k</i>\]
: An array of <strong><i>k</i></strong> <strong><i>n</i></strong>-bit integers, each in network byte order. The array length <strong><i>k</i></strong> is always determined by an earlier field in the message. Eg. Int16\[M\].

String(<i>s</i>)
: A null-terminated string (C-style string). There is no specific length limitation on strings. If <strong><i>s</i></strong> is specified it is the exact value that will appear, otherwise the value is variable. Eg. String, String("user").

> Note: There is no predefined limit on the length of a string that can be returned by the backend. Good coding strategy for a frontend is to use an expandable buffer so that anything that fits in memory can be accepted. If that's not feasible, read the full string and discard trailing characters that don't fit into your fixed-size buffer.

String\[<i>k</i>\]
: An array of <strong><i>k</i></strong> null-terminated strings (C-style strings). The array length <strong><i>k</i></strong> is always determined by an earlier field in the message. Eg. String\[N\]. 

Byte<i>n</i>(<i>c</i>)
: Exactly <strong><i>n</i></strong> bytes. If the field width <strong><i>n</i></strong> is not a constant, it is always determinable from an earlier field in the message. If <strong><i>c</i></strong> is specified it is the exact value. Eg. Byte2, Byte1('\n').

## Message Formats

This section describes the detailed format of each message. Each message is classified to indicate that it may be sent by a frontend (client), or a backend (server). In most cases, the first byte of a message identifies the message type, and the next four bytes specify the length of the rest of the message (this length count includes itself, but not the message-type byte). The remaining contents of the message are determined by the message type. There are a few message types that have no initial message-type byte.

### Frontend

| Byte1      | 'S' to close a prepared statement; or 'P' to close a portal.                                                              |
| String     | The name of the prepared statement or portal to close (an empty string selects the unnamed prepared statement or portal). |

#### CopyData 'd'

| Type       | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Byte1('d')  | Identifies the message as COPY data.                                                                           |

| String     | The name of the prepared statement or portal to describe (an empty string selects the unnamed prepared statement or portal). |

#### EndOfBatchRequest 'j'

| Type       | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Byte1('j') | Identifies the message as a EndOfBatchRequest command. Signals that a batch of rows has been sent, and the client is expecting an acknowledgment and possibly rejected row descriptions from the server. |

|:-----------|:------------|
| Byte1('E') | Identifies the message as an Execute command.  |
| Int32      | Length of message contents in bytes, including self.  |
| String     | The name of the portal to execute (an empty string selects the unnamed portal). |
| Int32      | Maximum number of rows to return, if portal contains a query that returns rows (ignored otherwise). Zero denotes "no limit". ***Note***: Currently, Vertica backend will ignore this result-row count and send all the rows regardless of what you put here. |

#### Flush 'H'

| Type       | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Byte1('H') | Identifies the message as a Flush command.           |
| Int32(4)   | Length of message contents in bytes, including self. |

#### LoadBalanceRequest

| Type       | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Int32(8)        | Length of message contents in bytes, including self.  |
| Int32(80936960) | The LoadBalance request code. The value is chosen to contain *1235* in the most significant 16 bits, and *0000* in the least 16 significant bits. (To avoid confusion, this code must not be the same as any protocol version number.) |

#### MarsRequest '\_'

| Type        | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| Byte1('\_') | Identifies the message as a MARS request.            |
| Int32(20)   | Length of message contents in bytes, including self. |
| Int32       | ResultSet ID                                         |

#### Parse 'P'

| Type       | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Byte1('P') | Identifies the message as a Parse command. |
| Int32      | Length of message contents in bytes, including self.  |
| String     | The name of the destination prepared statement (an empty string selects the unnamed portal, i.e. prepared statement must be named). |
| String     | The query string to be parsed.  |
| Int16      | The number of parameter data types specified (may be zero). Note that this is not an indication of the number of parameters that might appear in the query string, only the number that the frontend wants to pre-specify types for. |
| Then, for each parameter, there is the following: | |
| Int32      | Specifies the object ID of the parameter data type. Placing a zero here is equivalent to leaving the type unspecified. The server will ignore these values. |                                                                                                           |

#### Password 'p'

| Type       | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Byte1('p') | Identifies the message as a password. |
| Int32      | Length of message contents in bytes, including self. |
| String     | The password (encrypted, if requested). All password strings processed by Vertica require a null terminator, as is standard with any string in the Front End / Back End protocol. GSS is special because Vertica doesn't touch the buffer it gets -- it defers to the GSS library instead. It is an error to send an extra null terminator in a GSS token message. |

#### Query 'Q'

| Type       | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Byte1('Q') | Identifies the message as a simple query.            |

| Type       | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Int32(8)   | Length of message contents in bytes, including self. |
| Int32(80877103) | The SSL request code. The value is chosen to contain *1234* in the most significant 16 bits, and *5679* in the least 16 significant bits. (To avoid confusion, this code must not be the same as any protocol version number.) |

### Setup and Usage

This DC Table is turned on by default. As with other session DC tables, this table contains columns for 'time', 'node_name', 'session_id', 'user_id', and 'user_name'. The unique columns for this DC table are 'source', 'message_type', and 'contents'. The 'source' column describes whether the messages is a Frontend (FE) or Backend (BE) message. 'message_type' provides the character ID that distinguishes the type of message. Additionally, verbose messages will have a "+" appended to the single character message_type column. For example, the StartupRequest message KV pairs each are represented as a row in the table with the message_type "^+". The 'contents' column lists the set of contents being logged, if any, for that message type.

#### Sample Query
```sql
=> SELECT source, message_type, contents FROM DC_CLIENT_SERVER_MESSAGES;
```

#### Clearing the DC Table
```sql
=> SELECT clear_data_collector('ClientServerMessages');
```
